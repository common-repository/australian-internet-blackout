== Description ==

The Australian government is proposing to introduce mandatory ISP level Internet filters in Australia. These will operate using a secret blacklist of URLs maintained by the ACMA.

This plugin is to help people participate in ***The Great Australian Internet Blackout***. The protest against the proposed filters aims to blackout websites from 25 to 29 of January.

When activated this plugin displays a message about the protest to each visitor. The message can be clicked away, and will not appear until next time they start their browser and visit your site (i.e. once per session).
